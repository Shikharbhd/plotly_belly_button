# plotly_belly_button

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to create a web application dashboard using Javascript and Plotly to display belly button bacteria data from several different research volunteers. The interactive dashboard enables the user to select the Test Subject ID number and the dashboard would display the results for that specific ID number. The requested results to be displayed were:

a. Demographic Information

b. Bar chart of the top 10 bacteria cultures found

c. Indicator chart of belly button washing frequency

d. Bubble chart of bacteria cultures per sample


The Dashboard can be viewd at https://shikharbhd.github.io/plotly_belly_button/
